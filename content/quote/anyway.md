> Be honest and frank anyway.
> People are often unreasonable, illogical and self-centered;
> Forgive them anyway.
> If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives;
> Be kind anyway.
> If you are successful, you will win some false friends and some true enemies;
> Succeed anyway.
> What you spend years building, Someone could destroy overnight;
> Build anyway.
> If you find serenity and happiness, they may be jealous;
> Be happy anyway.
> The good you do today, people will often forget tomorrow;
> Be good anyway.
> Give the world the best you have, And it may never be enough;
> Give the world the best you have anyway.
> You see, in the final analysis, it is between you and God;
> It is never between you and them anyway.
