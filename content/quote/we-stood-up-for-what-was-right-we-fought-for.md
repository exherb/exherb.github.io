> We Stood up for what was right. We fought for moral reasons. We passed
> laws, struck down laws for moral reasons. We waged wars on poverty,
> not poor people. We sacrificed. We cared about our neighbors. We put
> our money where our mouths were and we never beat our chest. We built
> great big things, made ungodly techonological advances, explored the
> universe, cured diseases, and we cultivated the world’s greatest
> artists, and the world’s greatest economy. We reached for the stars,
> acted like man. We aspired to intelligence. We didn’t belittle it. It
